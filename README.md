  --component_id COMPONENT_ID

usage: app.py from-arguments [-h] --hd5_location HD5_LOCATION [--seed SEED]
                             [--num_patch_workers NUM_PATCH_WORKERS]
                             [--store_thumbnail]
                             {from-hd5-files,use-manifest,use-directory} ...

positional arguments:
  {from-hd5-files,use-manifest,use-directory}
                        Specify how to load slides to extract.
                            There are 3 ways of extracting slides: from hd5 files, by manifest and by directory.
    from-hd5-files      uses pre created hd5 files located at hd5_location to create and store images in patch_location

    use-manifest        Use manifest file to locate slides.
                                a CSV file with minimum of 4 column and maximum of 6 columns. The name of columns
                                should be among ['origin', 'patient_id', 'slide_id', 'slide_path', 'annotation_path', 'subtype'].
                                origin, slide_id, patient_id must be one of the columns.

    use-directory       Use a rootdir to locate slides.
                            It is expected that slide paths have the structure '/path/to/rootdir/slide_pattern/slide_name.extension' where slide_pattern is usually 'subtype'. Patient IDs are extrapolated from slide_name using known, hardcoded regex.

optional arguments:

                         (default: None)

  --store_thumbnail     Whether or not save thumbnail with showing the position of extracted patches. If yes, it will be stored at a folder called Thumbnails in HD5 folder.

positional arguments:
  {use-slide-coords,use-annotation,use-entire-slide,use-mosaic}
                        Specify which coordinates in the slides to extract.
                                There are 3 ways of extracting patches: by slide_cords, by annotation, and by entire_slide.
    use-slide-coords    Specify patches to extract using slide coordinates.
                                A slide coords JSON file containing keys 'patch_size' and 'coords'.
                                The key 'patch_size' gives the pixel width, height of the patch.
                                Coordinates are a list of size 2 lists of numbers representing the x, y pixel coordinates.
                                The [x, y] list represents the coordinates of the top left corner of the patch_size * patch_size extracted patch.
                                Coordinates are indexed by slide name for the slide the patches are from, and annotation the patches are labeled with.
                        
                                {

                                }

    use-annotation      Specify patches to extract by annotation.
                                If a slide is named 'VOA-1823A' then the annotation file for that slide is a text file named 'VOA-1823A.txt' with each line containing (i.e.):
                        
                                Tumor [Point: 84332.8046875, 68421.28125, Point: 84332.8046875, 68421.28125,...]
                                Stroma [...]

    use-entire-slide    Extracting patches from the whole slide. In this way,
                                both tumor and normal areas will be extracted.
                                The label is called Mix.

    use-mosaic          Selecting patches from the whole slide in an efficient way.
                                In this way, first all patches will be clustered based on their RGB histogram.
                                Then, in each cluster, another clustering will be applied for their coordiantes.

In order to increase the speed of extract_annotated_patches, We should run parallel jobs. In order to achieve this, you should use this bash script file:
```
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name Patch Extraction
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task 1
#SBATCH --array=1-<num_slides>
#SBATCH --output path/to/folder/%a.out
#SBATCH --error path/to/folder/%a.err
#SBATCH --workdir /projects/ovcare/classification/singularity_modules/singularity_extract_annotated_patches
#SBATCH --mail-type=FAIL
#SBATCH --mail-user=<email>
#SBATCH -p upgrade

singularity run -B /projects/ovcare/classification -B /projects/ovcare/WSI singularity_extract_annotated_patches.sif from-arguments \
 --hd5_location path/to/folder \
 --num_patch_workers 1 \
 use-directory \
 --patch_location path/to/folder \
 --slide_location path/to/folder \
 --slide_pattern subtype \
 --slide_idx $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID \
 --store_extracted_patches \
 use-entire-slide \
 --slide_coords_location path/to/file \
 --patch_size 2048 \
 --stride 2000 \
 --resize_sizes 512 \
 # --max_slide_patches 10


```

1. The number of arrays should be set to value of `num_slides / num_patch_workers`.
2. For fastest way, set the `num_patch_workers=1`, then number of arrays is `num_slides`.
